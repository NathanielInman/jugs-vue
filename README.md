## Thanks

This boilerplate of mine is just a combination of great tools, all credit goes to
those who actually put in all the hard work to create them.

- [Vite.js][7] has been an instrumental boost in productivity and clean code, allowing the
  the use of the ES2015 module system. Moving from webpack has greatly improved speed
- Though [Pug][1] (formerly Jade,) has been seen predominately as a server-side helper
  for templating, I find it incredibly helpful on front-end projects where I'm using a
  build system anyways, as the syntax is far easier to read and reduces duplication of
  segments with partials.
- From css to less to sass to [Stylus][2], it's been a long road with css pre-processors,
  but I finally found one that lets me drop all the redundant syntax and focus more on the
  design. I love my curly brace languages, but personally think that it gets in-between
  me and focusing on what's important when dealing with UX, wireframing or general
  design.
- No more worrying about vendor prefixes! [Autoprefixer][4] has been an instrumental
  improvement to my workflow when it comes to styling. None of that would be possible
  without [PostCSS][3] and all of the benefits it's brought to frontend development.
- If you're still coding without a linter like [ESLint][5], I'm not sure whether to
  give you a high-five for all the hard work or question your dedication for only
  stupidity.
- Dropped Traceur for [Babel][6] (formerly 6to5) because it has more readable compiled
  code as well as a much more versatile transpilation story when it comes to upcoming
  features to javascript. You can gather more specifics on comparisons of the two at
  their website.
